Hybro AI is an open-source, hybrid multi-agent platform built for seamless agent interoperability. It serves as the core orchestration engine powering the Hybro Agent Network—enabling local and remote AI agents to communicate, collaborate, and execute complex workflows.

## Overview
Hybro AI allows developers and teams to deploy, coordinate, and inspect clusters of autonomous AI agents. Powered by an async FastAPI backend and an interactive Next.js dashboard, Hybro provides real-time agent visualization, execution room management, and protocol-agnostic message routing via the Agent2Agent (A2A) standard.

### Key Features
- **Hybrid Agent Execution**: Seamlessly connect and orchestrate local on-device agents and remote cloud-hosted services.
- **Native Agent Interoperability**: Built around the open Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol for standardized inter-agent communication.
- **Multi-Agent Execution Rooms**: Group specialized agents in dedicated execution rooms to solve multi-step tasks collaboratively.
- **Real-Time Streaming & Inspection**: Live SSE message streaming, multi-agent turn timelines, and an interactive A2A Agent Inspector for testing agent capabilities.
- **Zero-Config Developer Mode**: Start the frontend and backend instantly out of the box with zero required external API keys.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20.19+ (if running the frontend outside of Docker)
- Python 3.12+ (if running the backend outside of Docker)

### Quick Start (Docker)
The easiest way to get started is using the automated installation script, which will clone the repository, set up the environment, and spin up the Docker containers.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hybroai/hybro/main/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can manually clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hybroai/hybro.git
cd hybro
docker compose up -d --build
```

- **Hybro App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:8000

## Architecture
The repository is split into two primary components:
- `backend/`: A FastAPI application that serves as the orchestration engine, utilizing Redis for real-time pub/sub and MongoDB for persistence.
- `frontend/`: A Next.js 16 (Turbopack) application for chat, agent discovery, agent management, Hub status, and inspection.
