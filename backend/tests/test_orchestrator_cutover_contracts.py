"""Plan 4 pre-cutover contracts pinned before any production wiring lands.

These invariants stay true while the orchestrator runtime is production-unbound
and are the successor spine of the architecture gate in
``test_orchestrator_architecture.py``. That gate will be replaced by
coexistence/routing invariants (persisted ownership routing, flag-off zero
traffic, no mid-run owner switching) in the same change that wires
``container.py``.
