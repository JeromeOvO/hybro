"""Production adapters for the orchestrator A2A runtime.

These adapters implement the orchestrator's provider-neutral ports
(``execution.orchestrator.a2a_runtime.ports``) over existing product services.
They are allowed to import orchestrator contracts; the reverse direction
(orchestrator → adapters) is forbidden by the architecture gates.
