"""SDK-free card normalization and SDK card construction.

Card data reaches the adapter in several shapes: an internal ``AgentCard``, a
raw dict from persistence, or a card fetched from the wire. All of them are
converted to a plain dict here and then parsed by the SDK's own card parser,
which also maps the pre-1.0 ``url``/``preferredTransport``/``protocolVersion``
shape onto ``supportedInterfaces``. That keeps legacy and 1.0 agents on one
code path instead of two hand-written variants.
